Usage 
=====

The project consists of multiple notebooks that work and interact together. For the full descriptions, explanations and such please see [Main notebook](https://scaperex.github.io/DUBUS/).

- *[Lab4_Main.ipynb](code/Lab4_Main.ipynb)* includes explanations and descriptions about Part 1 (Preprocessing & App) and Part 2 (EDA, Article and App).

- *[Lab4_Preparations.ipynb](code/Lab4_preparations.ipynb)*, *[Lab4_UI_part1.ipynb](code/Lab4_UI_part1.ipynb)*, *[Lab4_UI_part2.ipynb](code/Lab4_UI_part2.ipynb)* and *[Lab4_functions.ipynb](code/Lab4_functions.ipynb)* hold the code used in the project. 

- *[Lab1.ipynb](code/Lab1.ipynb)*, *[Lab2.ipynb](code/Lab2.ipynb)*, *[Lab3.ipynb](code/Lab3.ipynb)* - all the notebooks from the previous tasks. Used to reproduce helper indices. 


After performing the [installation steps](#installation), here is how to use the app in real time.

Prerequisites:
1. Databricks Cluster: should be turned on
2. VM:
   - Should be turned on
   - Then, 
   ```bash
   cd dubus_app
   sudo docker-compose up &
   ```
   
If this is your first time running the app, please refer to first time setup part in the [installation guide](./INSTALLATION.md#first-time-setup).

Once the app is up and running you can use it easily, just follow the in-app instructions.

Notes,

1. As we are displaying our app inside the Databricks, you must have a valid Databricks account inorder to interact with the app. 
2. The VM server must be on for the app to work.
3. There are security limitations. Please see the notes in [Lab4_Main.html](Lab4_Main.html) on how to deal with them.

Installation
============
We provide full explanations on how to set up and get the app up and running on **your** system as well.

For the full installation guide please see the [installation guide](./INSTALLATION.md)

However, **be aware!** There are a lot of steps that need to be taken in order to allow everything (DataBricks, Kibana, ElasticSearch) to work and communicate with each other.
