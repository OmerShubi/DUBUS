Project Overview
================
The app includes two parts - **DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Congestion** and **DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Analytics**.

DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Congestion
-----------------------------------
This part of the application includes an interactive map that displays the journeys with congestion, from uploaded stream or batch bus data.

DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Analytics
----------------------------------
This part of the application includes modern-day data exploration tools, bundled in a convenient interface.

Part of the app:

Usage 
=====

DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Congestion is run from *[Lab4_UI_part1.ipynb](code/Lab4_UI_part1.ipynb)* and DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Analytics is run from *[Lab4_UI_part2.ipynb](code/Lab4_UI_part2.ipynb)*.

Once the app is up and running you can use it easily, just follow the in-app instructions. 

The in-app instructions describe in detail the different options that you have when using the application, and also thorough instructions on how to use the app.

Follow the [installation steps](#installation) to install the app on your machine.

Additionally, if this is your first time running the app, please refer to **first time setup** part in the [installation guide](./INSTALLATION.md#first-time-setup).

Notes,

1. As we are displaying our app inside Databricks, you must have a valid Databricks account inorder to interact with the app. 
2. The VM server must be on for the app to work.
3. There are security limitations. Please see the **notes section** in the [installation guide](./INSTALLATION.md#notes) on how to deal with them.


Code Structure
==============

The project consists of multiple notebooks that work and interact together.

*Lab4_Preparations* consists of the preprocessing part, in which we also train and save the ML model, and the relevant helper models (indexer and encoder, for categorical variables).

*Lab4_UI_part1* - The front-end of the DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Congestion App (first part).

*Lab4_UI_part2* - The front-end of the DUBUS - Dublin Bus Trips Analytics App (second part).

*Lab4_functions* includes all the functions we used through out the project. Includes back-end connection functions (such as connecting to Elastic) as well. 

In addition, *Lab4_Main*  includes explanations and descriptions about the reasoning behind Part 1 (Preprocessing & App) and Part 2 (EDA, Article and App). 

Installation
============
We provide full explanations on how to set up and get the app up and running on **your** system as well.

For the full installation guide please see the [installation guide](./INSTALLATION.md)

However, **be aware!** There are a lot of steps that need to be taken in order to allow everything (DataBricks, Kibana, ElasticSearch) to work and communicate with each other.
